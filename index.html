                At one point i got stuck and asked my friend who've been into coding stuff since senior high.
                He asked me back,
                "Are you sure? You want me to tell you and lose the joy of finding it out by yourself"
                I paused a bit, and think to myself;
                "Yeah, no, I've never find the joy in this anyway."
