            <p>At one point i got stuck and asked my friend who've been into coding stuff since senior high.
                He asked me back;</p>
            <p><i class="quote">"Are you sure? You want me to tell you and lose the joy of finding it out by yourself"</i></p>
            <p>I paused a bit, and think to myself;</p>
            <p><i class="quote">"Yeah, no, I've never find the joy in this to begin with."</i></p>
            <p>A quick look in my head, I know that my joy isn't about solving this puzzle, it's about when i get to realize my idea.
                As unfortunate as I might not fit precisely in this field, I know I can do it. And that offset? I'm glad I have that sharp edge.</p>

            <p>After my second semester, I made up my mind that the college I attended was somewhat kind of stupid.
            I didn't take the 3rd semester and all hell set loose. With my parents, my family, even my friend.
            One of them said to me that I am running away. And well she might be right, but i don't think that running away from that path is wrong.
            The path that i knew well would waste a lot more than what I wasted in that two semesters.</p>
            <p>I spent few years after studying fields and learning crafts that I have interest on -some that I ended up learning without having any interest at all-
                I do not have any validation for any of that, but, I do feel that for the time being, I have enough knowledge that I can use pursuing my goals.</p>
