                I really like their idea to have the students write weekly reflection and/or just blogging
                in general. It will really help to improve our writing skill, in which I believe is also
                a form of thinking in itself. More than abstract thinking, as we write we also sort out our
                mind, thoughts, idea, anything in our brain, while also training our ability to make structures-
                something that I find to be much more useful than I initially thought, in and out of our
                depressing time, during our quest to reach a goal, -or actually, just any aspect in life, if we
                want to be proper, which we should.

                My current concern at the moment is about my loan application... Also despite liking this
                idea of writing and bloggin our activity and reflection, I unfortunately find myself lacking the
                time to invest more into this.
