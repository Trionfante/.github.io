            <p>At one point i got stuck and asked my friend who've been into coding stuff since senior high.
            He asked me back;</p>
            <p><i class="quote">"Are you sure? You want me to tell you and lose the joy of finding it out by yourself"</i></p>
            <p>I paused a bit, and think to myself;</p>
            <p><i class="quote">"Yeah, no, I've never find the joy in this to begin with."</i></p>
            <p>A quick look in my head, I know that my joy isn't about solving this puzzle, it's about when i get to realize my idea.
            As unfortunately as I might not fit precisely in this field, I know I can do it. And that offset? I'm glad I have that sharp edge.</p>
