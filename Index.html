            At one point i got stuck and asked my friend who've been into coding stuff since senior high.<br>
            He asked me back,<br>
                <blockquote>"Are you sure? You want me to tell you and lose the joy of finding it out by yourself"<blockquote>
            I paused a bit, and think to myself;<br>
                <blockquote>"Yeah, no, I've never find the joy in this anyway."</blockquote>
